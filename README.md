This is my personal portfolio website to showcase the front-end projects I've worked on.
<br><br>
I designed the layout on Figma, and coded on VSCode.
<br><br>
The main tecnology I use here is ReactJS. For the stylization I use the library Styled Components (CSS in JS).
<br><br>
The layout is fully-based on the componentization of elements.
<br><br>
The website is available in English and Portuguese.

## 💻 Libraries
My portfolio was coded with React and uses the following libraries:
- react-i18next;
- react-icons;
- react-modal;
- react-router-dom;
- react-type-animation
- styled-components
- swiper

## 🎨 Layout concept
For this personal project, I wanted to design a layout that reminds of a code editor, with elements that resemble coding tags and styles that we use in front-end development. I chose the font and colors with that concept in mind, and also added a few animations.
<br><br>
My main phylosophy when designing a website layout is the "less is more" idea. I like simple but great-looking layouts, with good proportions and alignments.
<br><br>
The layout is fully-responsive, with mobile and desktop versions.
